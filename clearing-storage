Most users typically attempt to clear their storage by deleting simple files such as images, downloads, or videos. This normally doesn't do much and also users forget to empty their recycle bin too.

Every time I've ever helped someone clear up some storage on their device, this is what I've done: and 9/10 times there are always unwanted and unused programs!

Step 1.) Open Control Panel

Hit Windows key and search "Control Panel" or use keyboard shortcut "Windows + X" and select "Control Panel"

Step 2.) Find your installations

In the bottom left you should see "Programs" and beneath it "Uninstall a program", click on uninstall a program.

Here you will see every program that you have installed are that has been on your computer since acquiring.

Step 3.) Find unwanted programs

All you need to do now is find a program you never use or have never used, click on it, and press uninstall.

Examples of unwanted programs: a game you stopped playing (clears GBs of space), a software you stopped using (can free up hundreds of MBs)
