Windows uses small animations and effects that look nice but slow down older hardware, disabling these features can assist in your computer running smoother.

Step 1.) Open the respective Windows setting

Press Windows key and search "adjust the appearance of windows"

Step 2.) Change these setting

There are 2 options to do this, you can either:

Select Adjust for best performance


or manually uncheck things like:

Fade animations

Window transitions

Transparent effects

This makes the system feel much snappier without breaking anything.
