Startup apps

Disabling unnecessary startup apps can help improve your Windows boot time whether you're using your OS on a HDD or SSD, and can help reduce background processes.

Step 1.) Open task manager

Hit Windows key and search "Task Manager" or use the shortcut on your keyboard "Control + Shift + Escape"

Step 2.) Locate "Startup Apps"

In this section you will see installed programs and/or Windows tools that have the status "Enabled" or "Disabled"

You want to click on the apps you don't need opening when you turn your device on and click "Disable"

Why? These apps are constantly starting up in the background every time you turn your computer on, slowing down the BIOS time and using more resources in the background.

Once you've disabled all your desired programs, you can note down your "Last BIOS time:" and next time you turn on your computer that time should be reduced.
